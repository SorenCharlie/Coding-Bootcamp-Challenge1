# Coding-Bootcamp-Challenge1
First challenge for Berkeley Extension Bootcamp
## Description
This project was created to showcase my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Git. 
Given an exisitng index.html and stylesheet, I combined CSS properties for a more readable and organized stylesheet.
I also changed divs to sections to create semantic elements.
I checked that all the links worked and fixed the ones that were broken.
